# Changelog

All notable engineering loops for MONARCH Maintenance are logged here, oldest first
within each loop. Entries are never rewritten to look cleaner after the fact.

## Loop 1 — 2026-09-06

**Summary:** Repository forensics + governance baseline + start of core data model.

**Requirements affected:** §36.1 (pre-coding forensics), §19.3–19.5 (repo governance),
§26 (data model), foundation for §29 (RBAC).

**Findings:**
- This repo and the sibling `Monarch-Production-Module` repo were both placeholder-only
  (`index.html` + README) at the start of implementation — no existing Maintenance or
  Production application code to reuse or regress against.
- Two Supabase projects exist on the account; neither matches Maintenance's domain
  (one backs the unrelated `accountoperatingsystem` generic task app, the other backs
  `Raccoon`/Store Register and is currently paused). Decision: Maintenance gets its own
  dedicated Supabase project, consistent with the standalone-module requirement (§2.1).
- Vercel team `Monarch` and Sentry org `monarch-bo` already exist and already host the
  Production and AOS modules — Maintenance will be added alongside them, not create new
  team/org infrastructure.

**Material changes:**
- Added `IMPLEMENTATION_PACK.md` (full, unabridged v0.2 pack — verbatim contract).
- Added `CLAUDE.md` operating rules, `README.md`, `STATUS.md`, `APPROVAL_GATE.md`,
  `RISK_REGISTER.md`, this `CHANGELOG.md`, and `/docs/*` seams.
- (in progress) `supabase/migrations/` — core `maintenance` schema.
- (in progress) Next.js application skeleton.

**Tests:** none yet — no business logic committed yet in this loop.

**Deployment/reference:** none yet.

**Known limitations:** No UI, no business operations, no RLS policies enforced yet as
of the start of this entry. Updated as the loop completes — see STATUS.md for the live
picture, this entry is append-only history.

### Loop 1 completion update

Rather than rewrite the entry above, recording final state here (same append-only
principle as the rest of the system):

- Created dedicated Supabase project `monarch-maintenance-module`
  (`maavrlqkdrisjwzhjdgg`), `maintenance` Postgres schema, 21 tables per §26,
  RLS on all of them, exposed the schema over PostgREST.
- Locked lifecycle graph (§4) implemented as `status_transitions` + the
  `transition_case` / `take_ownership` / `acknowledge_case` / `reopen_case`
  SECURITY DEFINER RPCs. `cases`/`case_events`/`audit_log`/`idempotency_keys`
  have no client-facing UPDATE/INSERT policy for the sensitive paths, so the
  RPCs are the only way to mutate lifecycle state (§36.3 enforced in the
  database, not just the UI).
- Verified directly against Postgres (simulated JWT via `execute_sql`):
  happy-path Scenario A end to end, an invalid-transition rejection, reopen
  (Scenario F), idempotent replay (same idempotency key twice → one event),
  append-only enforcement (direct `case_events` insert denied by RLS), and
  the first-valid-actor ownership race (§28 — second `take_ownership` call
  correctly raised `ALREADY_OWNED`). Test seed data removed afterward; two
  demo staff logins were left in place (see STATUS.md) for the Boss to try
  the deployed app.
- Next.js (App Router, TS, Tailwind) app: login, case list, report-case
  form, case detail with acknowledge action and the Observation + Action
  Continuity Journal (§8), all mobile-first.
- Linked Vercel project `monarch-maintenance-module` (team `Monarch`) to
  this GitHub repo; pushing to `claude/new-session-edkk1u` auto-deploys.
  Confirmed the deployed `/login` page returns 200 with the expected markup.
- Created Sentry project `monarch-maintenance-module` in org `monarch-bo`
  and wired `@sentry/nextjs` client/server/edge instrumentation.

**Deviations from a "by-the-book" setup, with reasons:**
- Supabase/Sentry connection values (anon key, DSN) are committed as source
  fallbacks in `src/lib/supabase/config.ts` / `src/instrumentation*.ts`
  instead of Vercel-dashboard-only env vars, because the Vercel MCP tooling
  available in this session has no operation to set project environment
  variables (only `create_git_project` / `deploy_to_vercel`, neither of
  which takes env vars). Both values are non-secret, submit/read-only public
  identifiers by their respective platforms' own security model (protected
  by RLS and by DSN's write-only scope, not by secrecy) — the same category
  as a Firebase `apiKey`. No actual secret (service-role key, Sentry auth
  token) was committed. Recommend moving these to real Vercel env vars via
  the dashboard when convenient, for cleaner rotation — functionally nothing
  is blocked by leaving them as source fallbacks.
- This sandbox's own egress network policy blocks direct HTTPS to
  `*.supabase.co` and `*.vercel.app`, so local `next dev` could not be
  browser-tested here, and `e2e/smoke.mjs` could not be run in this
  environment at all. Backend logic was instead verified directly against
  Postgres (see above); the live Vercel deployment was verified via the
  Vercel MCP's own fetch tool (which runs outside this sandbox's network),
  confirming a real 200 response. The browser E2E script is written and
  ready to run against the live URL — see RISK_REGISTER.md.
- No SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN available, so source-map upload is skipped (build
  warns, does not fail); stack traces in Sentry will show minified code
  until a token is added.
- No automated test framework (Jest/Vitest/Playwright test runner) wired
  into `npm test` yet — §37's full test matrix is still scope debt, not
  satisfied by the manual verification above.
